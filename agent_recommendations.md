- **Why Useful**: Regulatory compliance and documentation needs

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1 (Immediate):
1. Create Hardware Integration Specialist
2. Create Real-time Systems Expert
3. Create Complex Systems Architect

### Phase 2 (Within 1 week):
4. Create Test Automation Engineer
5. Create Safety & Critical Systems Engineer
6. Create UI/UX Specialist

### Phase 3 (As needed):
7. Create remaining specialized agents based on task progress

## Agent Configuration Recommendations

### System Prompts Should Include:
1. Project context (rover mission control)
2. Technology stack (FastAPI, React, TypeScript, WebSocket)
3. Existing codebase patterns and conventions
4. Safety-critical nature of the project
5. Integration points with other systems

### Tools Each Agent Should Have:
- All agents: Read, Write, Edit, Search, Bash
- Hardware agents: Additional embedded debugging tools
- Test agents: Test framework runners
- UI agents: Component preview tools

## Expected Benefits

1. **Improved Context Management**: Each agent maintains deep context in their domain
2. **Faster Development**: Specialized knowledge reduces research time
3. **Better Quality**: Domain experts catch issues early
4. **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Main agent can delegate specialized tasks
5. **Parallel Development**: Multiple agents can work on different aspects simultaneously

## Success Metrics

- Reduction in task completion time by 40-60%
- Improved code quality in specialized domains
- Better architectural decisions through expert consultation
- Faster debugging of domain-specific issues
- More comprehensive test coverage

## Conclusion

The Rover Mission Control project is complex with diverse technical challenges spanning hardware integration, real-time systems, safety-critical controls, and modern web technologies. Creating these 9 specialized agents will provide the expertise needed to tackle the 370 pending work items efficiently while maintaining high quality and safety standards.
