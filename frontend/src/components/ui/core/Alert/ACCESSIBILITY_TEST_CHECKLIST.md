# Priority-Based Alert System - Accessibility Testing Checklist

## Overview
This checklist ensures the priority-based alert system meets WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards and provides an excellent user experience for all operators, including those using assistive technologies.

## WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance Checklist

- [ ] Alert content is read completely
- [ ] Available actions are announced
- [ ] Dismissal instructions are provided
- [ ] Multiple alerts don't overlap in announcements

## Keyboard Navigation Testing

### Navigation Patterns
- [ ] **Tab key**: Moves to next interactive element
- [ ] **Shift+Tab**: Moves to previous interactive element
- [ ] **Enter**: Activates primary action
- [ ] **Space**: Activates focused button
- [ ] **Escape**: Dismisses alert (where appropriate)
- [ ] **Arrow keys**: Navigate between multiple alerts
- [ ] **Home/End**: Jump to first/last alert

### Focus Management
- [ ] Critical alerts auto-focus appropriately
- [ ] Focus is trapped in critical alert modals
- [ ] Focus returns to trigger element after dismissal
- [ ] Focus indicators are clearly visible
- [ ] Focus doesn't move to hidden/dismissed alerts

## Visual Testing
