# Gemini Codebase Guide: /stories

This directory contains the stories for the Storybook component library. Each story represents a single visual state of a component.

## Files

- **`*.stories.ts`**: These files define the stories for each component. They import the component and provide different variations of it by passing different props.
- **`*.tsx`**: These are the actual React components that the stories are based on.
- **`*.css`**: CSS files for styling the components within Storybook.
- **`Configure.mdx`**: A Markdown file that likely provides documentation on how to configure the components or the Storybook environment itself.
