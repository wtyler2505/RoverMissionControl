# Gemini Codebase Guide: /backend/rbac

This directory is intended to hold the implementation of the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system.

## Purpose

This directory would be responsible for:

- Defining user roles (e.g., admin, operator, viewer).
- Mapping roles to specific permissions or scopes.
- Providing dependencies or middleware to protect API endpoints based on user roles.
