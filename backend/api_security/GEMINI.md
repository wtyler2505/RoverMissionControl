# Gemini Codebase Guide: /backend/api_security

This directory is intended to hold modules related to API security.

## Purpose

Based on the backend architecture documentation, this directory would contain modules for:

- **Authentication**: JWT token generation and validation.
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC) and permission checks.
- **Rate Limiting**: Middleware to prevent abuse of the API.
- **Input Validation**: Pydantic models for validating request bodies and parameters.
- **Secure Headers**: Middleware for adding security-related HTTP headers.
